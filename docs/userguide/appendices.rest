A2. Exceptions for Running WRF-Hydro with the Noah LSM
------------------------------------------------------

Support for the Noah Land Surface Model (LSM) within WRF-Hydro is
currently frozen at Noah version 3.6. Since the Noah LSM is not under
active development by the community, WRF-Hydro is continuing to support
Noah in deprecated mode only. Some new model features, such as the
improved output routines, have not been setup to be backward compatible
with Noah. Noah users should follow the guidelines below for adapting
the WRF-Hydro workflow to work with Noah:

-  **LSM initialization:** The simple wrfinput.nc initialization file
   created by the create_Wrfinput.R script does not currently include
   all of the fields required by the Noah LSM. Therefore, Noah users
   should use the WRF real.exe utility to create a wrfinput_d0x file.
   Refer to the WRF documentation and user guides for information on how
   to do this.

-  **Time-varying vegetation specifications:** While the Noah LSM will
   be properly initialized with green vegetation fraction from the
   wrfinput file, there is currently no automated method to update this
   field over time (e.g., seasonally based on climatology). Therefore,
   Noah users will need to provide these time-varying fields in the
   model input forcing files (e.g., LDASIN).

-  **Spatially varying parameters**: Spatially varying soil and
   vegetation parameters (e.g., soil_properties.nc) are not supported in
   Noah.

-  **Model outputs:** The updated output routines have not been adapted
   to work with Noah. Therefore, Noah users should always use
   io_form_outputs = 0 to activate the deprecated output routines.
   Scale/offset and compression options, CF compliance, augmented
   spatial metadata, etc. are not available in this deprecated mode.

A6. Noah land surface model parameter tables
--------------------------------------------

The Noah land surface model requires three parameter table files denoted
by the file suffix TBL. The variables contained within these files are
described in the tables below.

Please refer to the Noah land surface model documentation
(https://ral.ucar.edu/sites/default/files/public/product-tool/unified-noah-lsm/Noah_LSM_USERGUIDE_2.7.1.pdf)
for additional information.

**GENPARM.TBL -** This file contains global parameters for the Noah land
surface model.

A7. Noah-MP land surface model parameter tables
-----------------------------------------------

The Noah-MP land surface model requires three parameter table files
denoted by the file suffix TBL. The variables contained within these
files are described in the tables below.

As part of the work conducted for the National Water Model
implementation, the ability to specify a number of these land surface
model parameters spatially on a two or three dimensional grid was
introduced. This is done through the use of the compile time option
SPATIAL_SOIL and the specification of a netCDF format parameter file
with the default filename soil_properties.nc. A list of the variables
contained in this file is included in a table below as well.

**GENPARM.TBL -** This file contains global parameters for the Noah-MP
land surface model.

The variables are written to the HYDRO_RST file in the subroutine of
RESTART_OUT_nc in the Routing/module_HYDRO_io.F. The tables below
contain all the information on the dimensions and variables in the Hydro
RESTART file (HYDRO_RST).

A15. National Water Model (NWM) Configuration
---------------------------------------------

It is important to note here that the community WRF-Hydro modeling
system is currently the actual underlying modeling architecture that is
used in the NOAA National Water Model. This means that the community
WRF-Hydro model code is configurable into the National Water Model
configurations that runs in operations at the National Center for
Environmental Prediction (NCEP).

“\ *The NWM is an hourly cycling uncoupled analysis and forecast system
that provides streamflow for 2.7 million river reaches and other
hydrologic information on 1km and 250m grids. The model provides
complementary hydrologic guidance at current NWS River Forecast Center
(RFC) river forecast locations and significantly expanded guidance
coverage and type in underserved locations.*

*The NWM ingests forcing from a variety of sources including Multi-Radar
Multi-Sensor (MRMS) radar-gauge observed precipitation data and
High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR), Rapid Refresh (RAP), Global
Forecast System (GFS) and Climate Forecast System (CFS) Numerical
Weather Prediction (NWP) forecast data. USGS real-time streamflow
observations are assimilated and all NWM configurations benefit from the
inclusion of ~5500 reservoirs. The core of the NWM system is the
National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)-supported community
Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)-Hydro hydrologic model. WRF-Hydro
is configured to use the Noah Multi-*

*Parameterization (Noah-MP) Land Surface Model (LSM) to simulate land
surface processes. Separate water routing modules perform diffusive wave
surface routing and saturated subsurface flow routing on a 250m grid,
and Muskingum-Cunge channel routing down NHDPlusV2 stream reaches. River
analyses and forecasts are provided across a domain encompassing the
continental U.S. and hydrologically-contributing areas, while land
surface output is available on a larger domain that extends beyond the
continental U.S. into Canada and Mexico (roughly from latitude 19N to
58N). In addition, NWM forcing datasets are provided on this domain at a
resolution of 1km.*\ ”

There are different NWM configurations that run operationally. The full
list of the configurations and their specifics can be found at
https://water.noaa.gov/about/nwm. Below we provide the namelists for the
Standard Analysis configuration (self-cycling with 3-hour look-back,
used to initialize CONUS short- and medium-range forecasts) as the
sample namelists. Note that the name of the files are different from the
conventions used throughout this documentation and they match with the
name of the files in operation (A subset of the model parameter files
used by the operational implementation of the NWM is available on `NWM
website <http://www.nohrsc.noaa.gov/pub/staff/keicher/NWM_live/NWM_parameters/>`__).
The namelists for all the configurations are also being distributed with
the model code.
